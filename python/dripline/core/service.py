        It seems like there should be a way to do this with the existing SelectConnection.
        The problem is that the message handler needs to send a request and then be called
        not block the reply from being processed, and needs to get the reply from that processed response.
        The non-blocking part seems tricky. I'm sure there exists a good solution for this,
        maybe within asyncio and/or asyncore, but I don't know where it is. This seems to work.
