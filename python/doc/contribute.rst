Part of the motivation for moving to this incarnation is dripline is to make it easier for anyone to contribute.
We're trying to keep test coverage high, so a recommended test driven development workflow is (going to be soon, hopefully,) described below.

As always, `dripline is on github <github.com/project8/dripline>`_.
Branches are cheap, lets do more of those.
For more details, `this branching model<nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model>`_ has served us very well to date.
In particular, please note that master is for tagged/release versions while develop is the latest working version.
