#**dripline**
#####*Slow controls for medium scale physics experiments.*


While primarily developed and implemented in python 2.7.x, dripline is really a messaging standard and is intended to be usable in whatever language you like.
Similarly, dripline is implemented and tested exclusively using RabbitMQ 2.8.x on Debian 7.7.

The erlang subdirectory is for the now deprecated dripline 0.x and has only a 'spiritual' connection to dripline 1.x (in the python subdirectory).

###Getting help
Code documentation is produced using sphinx via reStructuredText which is distributed with the source. A [rendered](http://www.project8.org/dripline) version is hosted using github pages and the project8.org domain.
Specific guidance for the Project 8 prototype system, as running, can be found on the [hardware wiki](http://github.com/project8/hardware/wiki/Slow_Controls_home) (login required).
